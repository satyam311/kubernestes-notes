# Node Affinity

**DOC:** https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/

Node Selectors are great for basic pod placement based on node labels. But what if you need more control over where your pods land? Enter Node Affinity! This feature offers advanced capabilities to fine-tune pod scheduling in your Kubernetes cluster.

# Node Affinity: The Powerhouse ðŸ”¥
---
Node Affinity lets you define complex rules for where your pods can be scheduled based on node labels. Think of it as creating a wishlist for your pod's ideal home!

**Key Features:**
**Flexibility**: Define precise conditions for pod placement.
**Contro**l: Decide where your pods can and cannot go with greater granularity.
**Adaptability**: Allow pods to stay on their nodes even if the labels change after scheduling.


### Properties in Node Affinity

- **requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution** : This property defines a hard requirement that must be met for a Pod to be scheduled onto a Node. 
- **preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: This property defines a preference or soft requirement that the scheduler tries to meet on a best-effort basis.

**Required During Scheduling, Ignored During Execution**

This is the strictest type of Node Affinity. Here's how it works:

- Specify Node Labels: Define a list of required node labels (e.g., disktype=ssd) in your pod spec.
- Exact Match Requirement: The scheduler only places the pod on nodes with those exact labels.
- Execution Consistency: Once scheduled, the pod remains on the node even if the label changes.

### What is a daemonset?
- A daemon set is another type of Kubernetes object that controls pods. Unlike deployment, the DS automatically deploys 1 pod to each available node. You don't need to update the replica based on demand; the DS takes care of it by spinning X number of pods for X number of nodes.
- If you create a ds in a cluster of 5 nodes, then 5 pods will be created.
- If you add another node to the cluster, a new pod will be automatically created on the new node.

### Examples of daemonset
- kube-proxy
- calico
- weave-net
- monitoring agents etc

# What is a network policy

Network policy allows you to control the Inbound and Outbound traffic to and from the cluster. For example, you can specify a deny-all network policy that restricts all incoming traffic to the cluster, or you can create an allow-network policy that will only allow certain services to be accessed by certain pods on a specific port.

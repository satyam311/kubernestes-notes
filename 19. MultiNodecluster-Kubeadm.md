When we say kubeadm, it means we’re setting up a self-managed Kubernetes cluster, and that cluster must run on some underlying infrastructure, typically VMs (virtual machines) — whether on:

Cloud providers like AWS (EC2 instances), GCP (Compute Engine), or Azure (VMs)

On-premises physical servers

Or even local VMs (using tools like VirtualBox, VMware, or Multipass)
